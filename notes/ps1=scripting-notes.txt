Goal: Understand ps1 scripting syntax (basic)

Start the script file off with the following block:

Param(
    [param_data_type]$Key = "Value in quotes if string"
    [n_params] ... 
)

An essential component to a successful ps1 script is:

    --

    $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

    --

    meaning {
        which tells PowerShell that a non-terminating error should 
        be treated as a terminating error. 
    }

    Context {
        PowerShell has errors that don't automatically stop 
        executing (constant printing, etc.)
        }

    Solution {
        In automation applications (scripts) a fast fail 
        is preferred over a half-brokens automated state.
    }

    Related Knobs you see:
        code {
            -ErrorAction Stop
             }
        meaning {
            Same idea, but only for a single command 
                }
    
    The default behavior is "Continue" which tells the script/command
    to write the error, and go onto the next statement in the
    script.


Next, you have the actual command(s) you want the script to run.

They typically look like this:

tool_name ([arguments the tool expects]) 
  --$[parameter(s) previously defined] 
^^note: indent is TWO spaces, if the command is multiple lines,
it uses "--command" syntax

n_commands
