.github/workflows meaning:
    {
    subdir where ci/cd workflows live and where github expects workflow files to live to integrate
    seamlessly.       
    }

ci.yml meaning:
    {
    continuous integration file. could be named anything but better to name it representatively.
    }

    expected behavior:
    {
    if all syntax is proper, and conditions are met, the ci.yml (as per the name) essentially
    prepares a deliverable app integrating all features into a build ready for shipment.
    
    in order to have a shippable product (image), the ci best practice is to build and push to
    a container registry (GHCR for hello-devops project)
    }
