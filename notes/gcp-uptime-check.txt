Purpose: self-explanatory

Inputs (basic)

- can define protocol, resource type (what to hit), and frequency
- provide uptime information on deployed services
- takes the URL of the deployed service and endpoint to hit
- configurable period between each check to optimize noise/cost 
- configurable response timeout (if response takes longer than x,
  timeout the request)
- configurable content matching (contains/missing in response,
  custom text input to define exactly what the response should 
  include)
